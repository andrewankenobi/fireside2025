    <h3>The Path to Ironman</h3>
    <p>Looking back, it's interesting how life directs you. After finishing my engineering degree, there was this
        persistent feeling inside me. Not ambition, exactly, but <strong>a need to find out what I was really capable of.</strong> Maybe
        it came from hearing whispers, or direct words, that I wasn't quite measuring up. That feeling stayed with me. I
        felt drawn to finding a challenge, something intensely personal, where the only measure was my own effort and
        resilience.</p>

    <h3>Rediscovering Swimming, Discovering Triathlon</h3>
    <p>My first proper job after university was at Vodafone – a company many people know. It was stable, professional
        work. But the real shift, the thing that pointed me towards the challenge I craved, started quite unexpectedly
        there. An older colleague I worked with learned that I used to swim competitively when I was younger but had
        stopped years ago. There happened to be a swimming pool very close to our office, so he suggested we start
        swimming together during our lunch breaks. And we did, almost every single day. It felt good to be back in the
        water, that familiar feeling of physical effort I had missed.</p>

    <p>Then one day, casually over lunch, this colleague asked me, "Have you ever heard of something called triathlon?"
        He went on to say there was a club right here in Milan, supposedly 'pretty sweet,' and he was thinking about
        joining them. My immediate, almost automatic, internal reaction was, 'Triathlon? No way. Because of the
        running.' I genuinely disliked running. But I must confess, underneath that first thought, something else
        stirred – a strong flicker of intrigue. Why? Because deep down, <span class="italic">that</span> kind of
        multi-sport endurance challenge felt exactly like the demanding, personal test I realised I'd always been drawn
        to. Perhaps the running had just been a convenient excuse I'd allowed myself before, a reason not to take on
        something so big. But in that moment, feeling ready and truly up for a challenge, <strong>I decided to push past the old
        excuse. I decided to take the leap.</strong> I signed up for that triathlon club.</p>

    <h3>Entering the World of Triathlon (Late 90s/Early 00s)</h3>
    <p>When I first showed up, I didn't really know what I was doing, just that I had this burning desire to test
        myself. I was completely new to this world. You have to really picture what the world was like back then, though
        – this was the late 1990s, stretching into the very early 2000s. It feels like a different planet compared to
        now. Mobile phones were becoming more common, but they were simple devices, mostly for calls, maybe a clunky SMS
        message. Forget smartphones; they weren't really a thing yet. Internet? Yes, it existed, but it was often slow
        dial-up at home, not something constantly available in your pocket. There was absolutely no social media – no
        Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter feeds. No WhatsApp or other instant messaging apps. Communication was mostly
        face-to-face, or planned phone calls using landlines or those basic mobiles – using phone numbers people often
        actually memorised! It meant your life could be more compartmentalized; this growing triathlon passion could
        exist in its own space, separate from work, in a way that feels almost impossible today.</p>

    <h3>Finding Guidance and Humility</h3>
    <p>Thankfully, one of the experienced racers in the club back then, who also coached others, noticed me. He saw my
        raw enthusiasm, maybe also my lack of experience, and he essentially took me under his wing. His attitude was
        very practical and supportive: 'Okay,' he seemed to say, 'let's work together so you don't get injured straight
        away, and let's channel this passion of yours in the right direction.' It wasn't like I went out searching for a
        coach; it felt more like the right guidance found me when I took that first step.</p>

    <p>This coach, whose brother had competed in the Olympics, also shared something early on that really made me think.
        He said, basically, that in endurance sports, you have the Olympians, and then everyone else. While performance
        varies wildly, the underlying drive, the human element, is very similar across the board for those who commit.
        As someone who deeply admired the Olympics, almost to the point of obsession, this idea struck me. It suggested
        <strong>focusing less on hierarchy and more on the personal commitment involved.</strong> Much later, when I had the chance to
        meet and even share some kilometers with actual Olympians, I saw the truth in this. The best were often
        incredibly humble, showing deep respect for everyone's effort, regardless of speed. It taught me a powerful
        lesson about <strong>humility being tied to true excellence.</strong></p>

    <h3>From Olympic Distance to the Ironman Dream</h3>
    <p>Under guidance, I discovered a capability I hadn't known was there. I started doing better than expected, even
        getting the honour of representing my country. It felt good, naturally, but the process itself – the discipline,
        the pushing of limits – was the real draw. I found myself loving the intensity of the Olympic distance races,
        but also becoming deeply fascinated by the almost mythical challenge of the Ironman. After managing my first
        half-Ironman (70.3), the pull towards the full distance became too strong to ignore. That became the next big
        mountain to climb.</p>

    <h3>The Power of Perspective: "It's Just a Marathon"</h3>
    <p>Preparing for that first full Ironman brought its own internal challenges. The sheer scale of it, especially the
        idea of running a marathon after the long swim and bike, felt overwhelming at times. I remember expressing this
        specific fear to my coach. His reply was typically direct:</p>
    
    <p class="pull-quote">"When you get there, it's just a marathon."</p>
    
    <p>It sounded dismissive, almost crazy, at first. But as the hard training weeks went by, his words started to sink
        in. It was my first big lesson in the power of perspective.</p>

    <p><strong>How much energy do we waste worrying about the enormity of a task instead of just focusing on the next step?</strong>
        Could I train my mind, not just my body, to frame this final leg not as an impossible barrier, but simply as the
        next phase of the journey? That question became central to my preparation.</p>

    <p class="takeaway"><em>Section 1 Takeaway:</em> Pushing past self-doubt and embracing unexpected challenges can unlock hidden potential and redefine personal limits. The key often lies in perspective – reframing the daunting into the manageable.</p>

    <h3>Keeping Passion Separate (or Trying To)</h3>
    <p>So, I was deep in this Ironman world, training hard, driven by that internal need to tackle the challenge. And I
        was determined to keep it separate from my professional life at Vodafone. In that era before constant online
        sharing, it was easier to have distinct parts of your life. This felt like my personal proving ground, maybe
        something that didn't quite fit the 'engineer' box, so I kept it quiet.</p>

    <p>Then came a small request from a teammate at the triathlon club. He ran a tiny, niche magazine for trail runners
        – really small, maybe selling just a couple of hundred copies across the entire country. He asked if I could
        write a little something about my journey into triathlon, my motivations for attempting my first full Ironman. I
        agreed, thinking of it as just doing him a favour. I wrote something simple, sent it off, and honestly forgot
        about it. I couldn't imagine more than a handful of people ever seeing it.</p>

    <h3>An Unexpected Public Debut</h3>
    <p>Fast forward to race day for my first full Ironman in Nice, France. The race itself was everything I expected –
        intense, demanding, pushing me to my limits. But something completely unexpected happened during the bike leg.
        My support crew started getting calls and messages – my phone was blowing up. Colleagues from Vodafone were
        contacting them, asking, "Is that really him? The radio is talking about an engineer from Milan doing the
        Ironman right now!" I was stunned. That little article, meant for a tiny audience, had somehow landed on the
        desk of a well-known Italian radio personality who followed endurance sports. And he decided to talk about my
        story, live on air, while I was still out on the course! My quiet, personal challenge was suddenly,
        inexplicably, public knowledge. Imagine the shock!</p>

    <p>When I returned to work, I braced myself for awkward questions or maybe even judgment. But the reaction was...
        surprising. People weren't critical; they were genuinely curious, even impressed. They wanted to hear about this
        'crazy' thing I had done. This unexpected positive feedback started a new line of thinking in my head. Maybe
        this intense passion wasn't something to hide? Maybe it resonated with people more than I thought?</p>

    <h3>Identifying a Need: Professional Races in Italy</h3>
    <p>It also made me look more critically at the triathlon scene within Italy at the time. There was incredible
        passion, yes. People loved the sport. But the races themselves, compared to what I experienced in Nice, often
        lacked professionalism. Things like having basic changing facilities – sometimes just open areas where men and
        women changed together – or inconsistent course marking, or limited support. It wasn't through lack of heart,
        but perhaps lack of resources or experience in organising large-scale, polished events.</p>

    <p>Connecting the dots – my own intense experience, the unexpected positive public reaction, and the state of local
        races – a new, audacious thought began to form: What if Italy was ready for a truly professional triathlon
        experience? What if we could bring a major international brand, like Ironman, here? The idea felt huge, maybe
        even impossible at first. But it wouldn't leave me alone.</p>

    <h3>From Idea to Action: Forming a Company</h3>
    <p>I started talking cautiously with others in my club who shared a similar passion. The idea resonated. It grew
        from a 'what if' into a 'maybe we could'. We realized quickly, though, that passion alone wasn't enough. We
        needed structure, support, legitimacy. Through connections, we managed to get a meeting with the President of
        the Italian Triathlon Federation. He listened intently. He saw the potential, the energy we had. But he was also
        grounded in reality. He offered his mentorship, his guidance through the complex world of Italian sports
        politics (where, believe me, *everything* is linked to the Olympic committee structure), but with one firm condition: we had to be
        serious. <strong>We had to form a proper company.</strong> This wasn't just a hobby anymore; if we wanted his help to navigate
        the system and bring this vision to life, we had to treat it as a real business venture from day one. That
        meeting felt like standing on the edge of a much bigger commitment than just training for a race.</p>

    <p class="takeaway"><em>Section 2 Takeaway:</em> A personal passion, when combined with observing a real-world need and nudged by unexpected events, can spark an entrepreneurial vision. Taking that first structural step, like forming a company, transforms the dream into a tangible, demanding venture.</p>

    <h3>The Steep Learning Curve of Entrepreneurship</h3>
    <p>Taking the Federation President's words to heart, we did it. We formed the company. That step felt momentous,
        crossing a line from passionate athletes with an idea to actual entrepreneurs. And almost immediately, the
        learning curve felt vertical. It struck me profoundly how different dreaming about a business is from the
        day-to-day reality of building and running one.</p>

    <p>My engineering background gave me certain analytical skills, sure, but the business world, especially the events
        and sports management sphere we were entering, operated with an intensity I hadn't fully grasped.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, I was interacting with people who seemed to function on a different level – working tireless hours,
        switching between multiple languages effortlessly, making complex decisions with a speed that felt dizzying. It
        was intimidating, but also energizing. It showed me the level of dedication required. It wasn't just about
        having a good idea; <strong>execution, I realised, was everything,</strong> and it demanded skills I still needed to develop.</p>

    <h3>Navigating Italian Bureaucracy and Politics</h3>
    <p>Then came the practicalities of making things happen in Italy. This meant diving headfirst into the world of
        public administration, local politics, and navigating the intricate web of stakeholders. My early impression was
        that it felt like walking through a complex maze, sometimes like that 'house of cards' image where disturbing
        one element could affect everything else.</p>

    <p>I learned quickly that official titles or political affiliations often didn't predict the challenges. Similar
        hurdles, similar underlying human motivations, seemed to exist across the board.</p>

    <p>A huge lesson during this phase was understanding what truly drives decisions in these environments.</p>

    <p>It wasn't always about the stated benefits of the event – tourism, sport, community engagement. Often, it was
        about understanding the unstated needs, the political capital, the personal priorities of each individual
        involved. I had to learn to listen differently, to look beyond the surface and figure out, 'What does this
        person, this department, this town *really* need to feel invested in this?'</p>

    <p>And the sheer bureaucracy... it was a constant, often maddening, companion. Dealing with multiple municipalities for road closures,
        permits, police coordination – each with its own procedures, its own key people, its own pace. You don't get to
        pick your partners in public administration, and this taught me a lot about resilience and creative
        problem-solving.</p>

    <p>Some officials were fantastic, true partners who genuinely wanted to help. Others were indifferent, or seemed utterly overwhelmed by their own processes. You couldn't force things, but you couldn't give up either. The learning was about finding ways to work with the system, however flawed, to extract the necessary permissions and support.</p>

    <p>It required endless follow-up, patience, and sometimes, managing truly absurd situations – like that infamous Tuesday
        night call from the police station complaining we hadn't shown up for the race that was scheduled for Saturday!
        It was frustrating, yes, but also instructive. You learn to anticipate issues, to communicate relentlessly, and
        to just keep pushing forward, day after day.</p>

    <p>During this intense period, I often found myself reflecting on those earlier lessons from training. My coach's
        words, "It's just a marathon," took on a new meaning. Facing a mountain of paperwork or a seemingly impossible
        negotiation felt like hitting the wall in a race. <strong>The key was perspective – breaking down the overwhelming task
        into manageable steps.</strong> Solve this permit first. Prepare for *that* meeting. Don't get paralyzed by the scale of it all.</p>

    <p>And remember the 'why' – the passion for bringing this level of sport to the country, the belief in the project. That underlying
        purpose became the essential fuel needed to navigate the daily grind of bureaucracy and politics. It was becoming clear
        that building this company was its own kind of endurance event.</p>

    <p class="takeaway"><em>Section 3 Takeaway:</em> Entering a new field demands humility and rapid learning. Navigating complex systems like bureaucracy requires understanding unstated motivations and persistent, creative problem-solving – it's an endurance event in itself, fueled by purpose.</p>

    <h3>Organising the Races: Milan and Sardinia</h3>
    <p>Finally, after all the planning, negotiating, and bureaucratic hurdles, we were actually doing it – organising
        the races. We managed to put together a unique event in Milan, using part of a route famous from the Giro
        d'Italia, which felt incredibly special on a personal level. Full funding for an official Ironman branded race
        took longer to secure (that would come a couple of years down the line), but we found a way forward by
        partnering with another organisation, a spin-off from the Ironman world, to establish a major long-distance race
        in Sardinia. Seeing these events come to life, seeing athletes on courses we had planned, was exhilarating, but
        it also brought a whole new level of intensity and learning.</p>

    <h3>Knowing the Product: Obsessing Over Details</h3>
    <p>One thing became crystal clear: there is absolutely no substitute for knowing your 'product' inside and out.</p>

    <p>We couldn't just design a course on paper; we had to live it. We rode and ran those routes countless times,
        learning every pothole, every tricky corner, how the wind felt at different times of day, how the currents might
        behave in the water. We obsessed over the details that make a race special for an athlete – designing the best
        possible medal, thinking carefully about what should go in the race bag. The driving thought was always: <strong>let's
        create the race we would want to participate in.</strong></p>

    <p>This deep immersion wasn't just about quality control; it was about respect for the athletes and the monumental challenge
        they were undertaking.</p>

    <h3>Recognising Limits and Building a Core Team</h3>
    <p>Very quickly, though, the sheer scale of it all hit me. I had to confront the reality that I couldn't do
        everything, nor was I the best person for every task. This wasn't just about being busy; it was about <strong>recognising my own limitations. Learning to ask for help, and learning who to ask, became critical.</strong></p>

    <p>I reached back out to the Federation President who had mentored us. We brought in another experienced race
        organiser – technically a competitor, but willing to collaborate and share his knowledge, which was incredible.
        We convinced one of Italy's most respected triathlon officials, someone who had refereed at the Olympics, to
        become our Race Director. Another club president from the north, eager to bring bigger races to the country,
        joined us with infectious enthusiasm. Building this core team, trusting their expertise, and learning to
        communicate clearly and directly – <strong>cutting out the unnecessary noise and focusing on solutions</strong> – was maybe one
        of the most important steps we took.</p>

    <h3>Leading by Example: The Volunteer 'Family'</h3>
    <p>Then there were the volunteers. Organising events like these relies *heavily* on them, and leading volunteers, I
        discovered, is a unique challenge. You have no real leverage, their skill levels vary, and their motivation
        comes purely from goodwill. How do you ensure they show up, ready and motivated, rain or shine? How do you make them feel truly
        valued? We decided early on we had to lead by example and show profound gratitude. We put together what I think
        was the best volunteer package seen at the time – good quality shirts, useful swag, proper meals that my wife
        and I even helped prepare ourselves. More than that, I made the decision to literally camp onsite during the
        entire race week.</p>

    <p>No comfortable hotel. I wanted to be visible, accessible 24/7. If anyone had a question or a problem, day or
        night, they knew exactly where to find me.</p>

    <p class="pull-quote">The core principle was empathy: never ask someone to do something you wouldn't be willing to do yourself.</p>

    <p>We were transparent about the mission, why we were doing this, and we constantly emphasized how crucial they were
        – they were the face of the organization, the architects of the athlete experience. The result was astounding.
        We built a 'family' of around 1,500 volunteers who worked incredibly hard, supported each other, and truly owned
        their roles. Many had no prior triathlon experience but embraced the challenge with amazing spirit. Some still
        write to me today, remembering those intense, rewarding 'old days'.</p>

    <p>It taught me so much about the power of genuine leadership, trust, and making people feel part of something
        meaningful.</p>

    <h3>Flexibility, Setbacks, and Resilience</h3>
    <p>Of course, things rarely go exactly to plan. Flexibility became our mantra.</p>

    <p>I vividly remember one race day, I think it was the long course in Sardinia. We were short one person who could
        ride a motorbike, follow the lead professional athletes, and report back time gaps at checkpoints. It required
        being out there for five or six hours, keeping pace. My then-girlfriend (now wife), who spoke several languages
        and was helping run operations from the office, was the only one available who could potentially do it. I had to
        ask her, "Can you drop everything, hop on this motorbike, and follow these pros for the next half day?" She
        didn't hesitate. She just said yes and did it.</p>

    <p>It perfectly captured the <strong>'all hands on deck' spirit needed – sometimes you just have to do what needs doing for
        the team, regardless of your title or planned role.</strong></p>

    <p>But not all unexpected events are manageable with flexibility alone. We faced a major blow when the Federation
        President, our mentor and friend who had supported us so enthusiastically, passed away suddenly. He was in good
        health, full of life – it was a complete shock. Beyond the deep personal loss, it created instability. As often
        happens in politics, his successor wanted to review things, perhaps start from scratch, which created friction
        and new obstacles for our operations just as we were gaining momentum.</p>

    <p>It was a harsh lesson in resilience, in how quickly things can change due to factors completely outside your
        control, and the need to find a way to carry on even when grieving and facing renewed uncertainty.</p>

    <h3>Mission Accomplished: Brands Arrive in Italy</h3>
    <p>Despite the challenges, the setbacks, the endless grind, we achieved what we set out to do. The big brands came
        to Italy. Races were established. And there's a quiet satisfaction in knowing that one of the major races
        happening in Italy today uses a course we originally pioneered. The mission, in that sense, was accomplished.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection and Moving On</h3>
    <p>So, we had done it. Against considerable odds, the races were established, the big brands had a foothold in
        Italy, and a seed we planted was growing. The initial mission felt accomplished. And it was around this time
        that I started to reflect deeply on my own path. While the journey had been incredibly rewarding in terms of
        challenge and learning, I also had to be honest with myself. The day-to-day reality of running the company,
        especially the constant, full-time engagement with public administration and politics, wasn't where my long-term
        passion truly lay. The world of technology, my original field, kept pulling me back with its different kinds of
        problems to solve. Having achieved the goal I'd set out years earlier – to bring these brands to my home country
        – I felt I could step away with a sense of completion, ready for the next adventure. It wasn't about ending
        something, but about closing a significant chapter and starting a new one, <strong>carrying the lessons learned with me.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>How Strong Teams Are Forged</h3>
    <p>One of the deepest convictions that solidified during that intense period was about how truly strong teams are
        built.</p>

    <p>My experience leading those incredible volunteers, and working alongside the core team through immense pressure, confirmed something I think I always felt: great teams aren't forged in comfortable settings like happy hours or playing games. They are forged in 'the grinder' – by tackling difficult challenges together, facing setbacks, working tirelessly towards a common goal, and sharing the vulnerability and triumph of that process.</p>

    <p>There's an
        inner beauty and a deep bond that comes from going through hardship together. It's probably why I sometimes find
        superficial situations difficult; the connection feels more real when it's built on shared effort and purpose.
        It's the same satisfaction I find in things like volunteering for community projects – doing real work,
        side-by-side, that makes a difference.</p>

    <h3>Lasting Impact: Human Connections</h3>
    <p>And perhaps the most heartwarming lessons came from the human connections made along the way. I remember vividly
        a young woman we worked with in Sardinia. She was incredibly passionate about sports and dreamed of working for
        a major sports organisation. When we told her we were bringing a large international race to her island, she
        couldn't believe it. She worked around the clock for us, with infectious enthusiasm, even though we couldn't
        guarantee her a full salary at the beginning; we gave her what we could. Her dedication was inspiring. After our
        project phase, we were so grateful for her contribution that we helped introduce her to RCS Sport – the
        organisation behind huge events like the Giro d'Italia. She got her break, achieved her dream of working in
        professional sports organisation.</p>

    <p>Years later, completely out of the blue, she reached out to me. Knowing my passion for cycling, she had obtained
        an original cycling jersey from one of my heroes, Marco Pantani, during her work travels. She sent it to me as a
        gift. She remembered me, remembered the chance we gave her, however small or messy it might have seemed at the
        time, that helped her step towards her dream. It was a powerful reminder that sometimes, amidst all the stress
        and logistics of achieving a big goal, the most lasting impact is on the individual lives you touch and the
        opportunities you can help create.</p>

    <p>Following your own dreams feels even better when you can help someone else take a step towards theirs.</p>

    <h3>The Enduring Value of Big Challenges</h3>
