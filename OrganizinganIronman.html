    <h1>Lessons in Grit:
        What Organizing Triathlons
        Taught Me About Business & Life</h1>

    <h3>Immersion: Chaos & Calm</h3>
    <p > 
        Imagine yourself on the Mediterranean Sea, racing near Monaco. The start horn still echoes. You've just plunged into a churning chaos of water alongside three thousand bodies – a frantic explosion of bubbles, foam, splashing limbs, and a muffled roar that feels both exhilarating and terrifying. The water is a washing machine of close calls and shared adrenaline. 
         
        Then, you push off, find a sliver of space, and put your head down. Instantly, the world transforms. The roar fades to a deep, resonant hum. Everything outside is muted, distant. Down here, in the cool, incredible blue, there's only the rhythmic pull of your arms, the steady beat of your own heart in your ears, and the mesmerizing dance of sunlight filtering from above. A profound, almost sacred calm envelops you, a bubble of peace amidst the frenzy.
        
        You surface for air, gasping, and the world rushes back in – the sharp taste of salt, the feel of the sun warming your back, the undeniable rumble and splash of swimmers nearby. But now, looking towards the shore roughly a kilometer away, the chaos feels different. It's the energy of the challenge, and you can't help but smile, embracing the incredible day ahead.
    </p>
    <p>Looking back, it's interesting how life directs you. After finishing my engineering degree, there was
        this persistent feeling inside me. Not ambition, exactly, but <strong>a need to find out what I was really capable of.</strong> Maybe
        it came from hearing whispers, or direct words, that I wasn't quite measuring up. That feeling stayed with me. I
        felt drawn to finding a challenge, something intensely personal, where the only measure was my own effort and
        resilience.</p>

    <h3>The Spark: Rediscovering Swimming, Discovering Triathlon</h3>
    <p>My first proper job after university was at Vodafone – a stable, professional engineering role. The demanding nature of finishing my degree meant that sports, which had always been part of my life (some tennis, cycling, and competitive swimming when younger), had taken a backseat for a while. It felt good to be working, but I missed that physical outlet. A shift began unexpectedly at Vodafone. An older colleague learned I used to swim and suggested we hit the pool near our office during lunch breaks. We started going almost daily, and it felt fantastic to be back in the water, rediscovering that familiar effort. Then, one day, he casually asked, "Have you ever heard of triathlon?" He mentioned a club in Milan, thinking of joining.</p>
    <p>Triathlon... the idea immediately sparked something. It had always fascinated me, this multi-sport endurance challenge that seemed like the ultimate personal test I was subconsciously seeking. But my instant reaction was still, 'No way. Because of the running.' I truly disliked running and had always thought triathlon wasn't for me because of it. Maybe it was just a convenient excuse? This colleague, however, didn't just mention it; he encouraged me to give it a go, to face the running part. His nudge was what I needed. Feeling ready for a real challenge, <strong>I decided to push past the old excuse and chase that fascination. I signed up for the triathlon club.</strong></p>

    <p>When I first showed up, I didn't really know what I was doing, just that I had this burning desire to test
        myself. I was completely new to this world. You have to really picture what the world was like back then, though
        – this was the late 1990s, stretching into the very early 2000s. It feels like a different planet compared to
        now. Mobile phones were becoming more common, but they were simple devices, mostly for calls, maybe a clunky SMS
        message. Forget smartphones; they weren't really a thing yet. Internet? Yes, it existed, but it was often slow
        dial-up at home, not something constantly available in your pocket. There was absolutely no social media – no
        Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter feeds. No WhatsApp or other instant messaging apps. Communication was mostly
        face-to-face, or planned phone calls using landlines or those basic mobiles – using phone numbers people often
        actually memorised! It meant your life could be more compartmentalized; this growing triathlon passion could
        exist in its own space, separate from work, in a way that feels almost impossible today.</p>

    <h3>Entering a New World: Finding Guidance and Humility</h3>
    <p>Thankfully, one of the experienced racers in the club back then, who also coached others, noticed me. He saw my
        raw enthusiasm, maybe also my lack of experience, and he essentially took me under his wing. His attitude was
        very practical and supportive: 'Okay,' he seemed to say, 'let's work together so you don't get injured straight
        away, and let's channel this passion of yours in the right direction.' It wasn't like I went out searching for a
        coach; it felt more like the right guidance found me when I took that first step.</p>

    <p>This coach, whose brother had competed in the Olympics, also shared something early on that really made me think.
        He said, basically, that in sports, you have the Olympians, and then everyone else. While performance
        varies wildly, the underlying drive, the human element, is very similar across the board for those who commit.
        As someone who deeply admired the Olympics, almost to the point of obsession, this idea struck me. It suggested
        <strong>focusing less on hierarchy and more on the personal commitment involved.</strong> Much later, when I had the chance to
        meet and even share some kilometers with actual Olympians, I saw the truth in this. The best were often
        incredibly humble, showing deep respect for everyone's effort, regardless of speed. It taught me a powerful
        lesson about <strong>humility being tied to true excellence.</strong></p>

    <p>Under the guidance of the coach I mentioned earlier, and another pivotal coach who—in what would become a sadly recurring theme in this journey—passed away suddenly, leaving an immense void but also life-transforming lessons, I discovered a capability I hadn't known was there. I started doing better than expected, eventually winning a national ranking as a non-professional athlete in my age group. Because of this, the Federation invited me to represent my country – an incredible honour. While the recognition felt good, it was the process itself – the discipline, the pushing of limits – that truly drew me in. I found myself loving the intensity of the Olympic distance races, but also becoming deeply fascinated by the almost mythical challenge of the Ironman. After managing my first half-Ironman (70.3), the pull towards the full distance became too strong to ignore. That became the next big mountain to climb.</p>

    <h3>Pushing Further: The Allure of Ironman</h3>
    <p>Preparing for that first full Ironman brought its own internal challenges. The sheer scale of it, especially the
        idea of running a marathon after the long swim and bike, felt overwhelming at times. I remember expressing this
        specific fear to my coach. His reply was typically direct:</p>
    
    <p >"When you get there, it's just a marathon."</p>
    
    <p>It sounded dismissive, almost crazy, at first. But as the hard training weeks went by, his words started to sink
        in. It was my first big lesson in the power of perspective.<strong>How much energy do we waste worrying about the enormity of a task instead of just focusing on the next step?</strong>
        Could I train my mind, not just my body, to frame this final leg not as an impossible barrier, but simply as the
        next phase of the journey? That question became central to my preparation. So, I was deep in this Ironman world, training hard, driven by that internal need to tackle the challenge. And I
        was determined to keep it separate from my professional life at Vodafone. In that era before constant online
        sharing, it was easier to have distinct parts of your life. This felt like my personal proving ground, maybe
        something that didn't quite fit the 'engineer' box, so I kept it quiet.</p>

    <h3>The Unplanned Broadcast: Unexpected Exposure</h3>
    <p>Then came a small request from a teammate at the triathlon club. He ran a tiny, niche magazine for trail runners
        – really small, maybe selling just a couple of hundred copies across the entire country. He asked if I could
        write a little something about my journey into triathlon, my motivations for attempting my first full Ironman. I
        agreed, thinking of it as just doing him a favour. I wrote something simple, sent it off, and honestly forgot
        about it. I couldn't imagine more than a handful of people ever seeing it.</p>

    <h3>An Unexpected Public Debut</h3>
    <p>The unexpected twist actually happened <strong>before</strong> the race even started. I was driving to Nice, France, focused on the huge challenge ahead. Suddenly, my phone started buzzing relentlessly – text messages and calls pouring in. Friends and colleagues were contacting me, asking, "Is that really you? Someone on the radio is talking about an engineer from Milan, Andrea Vasco, doing the Ironman in Nice this weekend!" I was completely stunned. That tiny article I'd written for my teammate's niche magazine, the one I thought maybe a handful of people would ever see, had somehow landed on the desk of a well-known Italian radio personality who followed endurance sports. And he decided to talk about my story, live on air, <strong>before</strong> I even reached the starting line! My quiet, personal challenge, the one I was trying to keep separate from my professional life, was suddenly public knowledge. Even though I'd wanted to keep it under wraps, I had the immediate, sinking realization that upon my return to Vodafone, everyone would likely know exactly what I'd been up to.</p>
    <p>When I eventually returned to work after the race, I braced myself for awkward questions or maybe even judgment. But the reaction was...
        surprising. People weren't critical; they were genuinely curious, even impressed. They wanted to hear about this
        'crazy' thing I had done. This unexpected positive feedback started a new line of thinking in my head. Maybe
        this intense passion wasn't something to hide? Maybe it resonated with people more than I thought? It also made me look more critically at the triathlon scene within Italy at the time. There was incredible
        passion, yes. People loved the sport. But the races themselves, compared to what I experienced in Nice, often
        lacked professionalism. Things like having basic changing facilities – sometimes just open areas where men and
        women changed together – or inconsistent course marking, or limited support. It wasn't through lack of heart,
        but perhaps lack of resources or experience in organising large-scale, polished events.</p>

    <h3>A Critical Look: Seeing the Opportunity</h3>
    <p>Connecting the dots – my own intense experience, the unexpected positive public reaction, and the state of local
        races – a new, audacious thought began to form: What if Italy was ready for a truly professional triathlon
        experience? What if we could bring a major international brand, like Ironman, here? The idea felt huge, maybe
        even impossible at first. But it wouldn't leave me alone.</p>

    <h3>Seeking Legitimacy: The Crucial Meeting</h3>
    <p>Taking the Federation President's words to heart, we did it. We formed the company, a step that felt momentous, crossing a line from passionate athletes with an idea to actual entrepreneurs. Almost immediately, the learning curve felt vertical. It struck me profoundly how different dreaming about a business is from the day-to-day reality of building and running one. My engineering background gave me certain analytical skills, but the business world, especially the events and sports management sphere we were entering, operated with an intensity I hadn't fully grasped. Suddenly, I was interacting with people who seemed to function on a different level – working tireless hours, switching between multiple languages effortlessly, making complex decisions with a speed that felt dizzying. It was intimidating but also energizing, showing me the level of dedication required. It wasn't just about having a good idea; <strong>execution, I realised, was everything,</strong> and it demanded skills I still needed to develop.</p>
    
    <h3>Lessons: Navigating Complexity & Stakeholder Empathy</h3>
    <p>Then came the practicalities of making things happen in Italy. This meant diving headfirst into the world of public administration, local politics, and navigating the intricate web of stakeholders. My early impression was that it felt like walking through a complex maze, sometimes like that 'house of cards' image where disturbing one element could affect everything else. I learned quickly that official titles or political affiliations often didn't predict the challenges; similar hurdles and similar underlying human motivations seemed to exist across the board.</p>

    <p>A huge lesson during this phase was understanding what <strong>truly drives</strong> decisions in these environments.</p>

    <p>It wasn't always about the stated benefits of the event – tourism, sport, community engagement. Often, it was
        about understanding the unstated needs, the political capital, the personal priorities of each individual
        involved. I had to learn to listen differently, to look beyond the surface and figure out, 'What does this
        person, this department, this town *really* need to feel invested in this?'And the sheer bureaucracy... it was a constant, often maddening, companion. Dealing with multiple municipalities for road closures,
        permits, police coordination – each with its own procedures, its own key people, its own pace. You don't get to
        pick your partners in public administration, and this taught me a lot about resilience and creative
        problem-solving.Some officials were fantastic, true partners who genuinely wanted to help. Others were indifferent, or seemed utterly overwhelmed by their own processes. You couldn't force things, but you couldn't give up either. The learning was about finding ways to work with the system, however flawed, to extract the necessary permissions and support. It required endless follow-up, patience, and sometimes, managing truly absurd situations – like that infamous Tuesday
        night call from the police station complaining we hadn't shown up for the race that was scheduled for Saturday!
        It was frustrating, yes, but also instructive. You learn to anticipate issues, to communicate relentlessly, and
        to just keep pushing forward, day after day.</p>

    <p>During this intense period, I often found myself reflecting on those earlier lessons from training. My coach's
        words, "It's just a marathon," took on a new meaning. Facing a mountain of paperwork or a seemingly impossible
        negotiation felt like hitting the wall in a race. <strong>The key was perspective – breaking down the overwhelming task
        into manageable steps.</strong> Solve this permit first. Prepare for *that* meeting. Don't get paralyzed by the scale of it all. And remember the 'why' – the passion for bringing this level of sport to the country, the belief in the project. That underlying
        purpose became the essential fuel needed to navigate the daily grind of bureaucracy and politics. It was becoming clear
        that building this company was its own kind of endurance event.</p>

    


    <p>Finally, after all the planning, negotiating, and bureaucratic hurdles, we were actually doing it – organising
        the races. We managed to put together a unique event in Milan, using part of a route famous from the Giro
        d'Italia, which felt incredibly special on a personal level. Full funding for an official Ironman branded race
        took longer to secure (that would come a couple of years down the line), but we found a way forward by
        partnering with another organisation, a spin-off from the Ironman world, to establish a major long-distance race
        in Sardinia. Seeing these events come to life, seeing athletes on courses we had planned, was exhilarating, but
        it also brought a whole new level of intensity and learning.</p>

        

    <h3>Obsessing Over Details & Acknowledging Your Limits</h3>
    <p>One thing became crystal clear: there is absolutely no substitute for knowing your 'product' inside and out. We couldn't just design a course on paper; we had to live it. We rode and ran those routes countless times,
        learning every pothole, every tricky corner, how the wind felt at different times of day, how the currents might
        behave in the water. We obsessed over the details that make a race special for an athlete – designing the best
        possible medal, thinking carefully about what should go in the race bag. The driving thought was always: <strong>let's
        create the race we would want to participate in.</strong> It was about respect for the athletes and the monumental challenge
        they were undertaking.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, though, the sheer scale of it all hit me. I had to confront the reality that I couldn't do
        everything, nor was I the best person for every task. This wasn't just about being busy; it was about <strong>recognising my own limitations. Learning to ask for help, and learning who to ask, became critical.</strong> I reached back out to the Federation President who had mentored us. We brought in another experienced race
        organiser – technically a competitor, but willing to collaborate and share his knowledge, which was incredible.
        We convinced one of Italy's most respected triathlon officials, someone who had refereed at the Olympics, to
        become our Race Director. Another club president from the north, eager to bring bigger races to the country,
        joined us with infectious enthusiasm. Building this core team, trusting their expertise, and learning to
        communicate clearly and directly – <strong>cutting out the unnecessary noise and focusing on solutions</strong> – was maybe one
        of the most important steps we took.</p>

    <h3>Lesson: Lead with Empathy, Presence & Trust</h3>
    <p>Then there were the volunteers. Organising events like these relies *heavily* on them, and leading volunteers, I
        discovered, is a unique challenge. You have no real leverage, their skill levels vary, and their motivation
        comes purely from goodwill. How do you ensure they show up, ready and motivated, rain or shine? How do you make them feel truly
        valued? We decided early on we had to lead by example and show profound gratitude. We put together what I think
        was the best volunteer package seen at the time – good quality shirts, useful swag, proper meals that my wife
        and I even helped prepare ourselves. More than that, I made the decision to literally camp onsite during the
        entire race week.</p>

    <p>No comfortable hotel. I wanted to be visible, accessible 24/7. If anyone had a question or a problem, day or
        night, they knew exactly where to find me.</p>

    <p>The core principle was empathy: never ask someone to do something you wouldn't be willing to do yourself. We were transparent about the mission, why we were doing this, and we constantly emphasized how crucial they were
        – they were the face of the organization, the architects of the athlete experience. The result was astounding.
        We built a 'family' of around 1,500 volunteers who worked incredibly hard, supported each other, and truly owned
        their roles. Many had no prior triathlon experience but embraced the challenge with amazing spirit. Some still
        write to me today, remembering those intense, rewarding 'old days'. It taught me so much about the power of genuine leadership, trust, and making people feel part of something
        meaningful.</p>

    <h3>Lesson: Resilience, Setbacks & Impermanence</h3>
    <p>Of course, things rarely go exactly to plan. Flexibility became our mantra. I vividly remember one race day, I think it was the long course in Sardinia. We were short one person who could
        ride a motorbike, follow the lead professional athletes, and report back time gaps at checkpoints. It required
        being out there for five or six hours, keeping pace. My then-girlfriend (now wife), who spoke several languages
        and was helping run operations from the office, was the only one available who could potentially do it. I had to
        ask her, "Can you drop everything, hop on this motorbike, and follow these pros for the next half day?" She
        didn't hesitate. She just said yes and did it. It perfectly captured the <strong>'all hands on deck' spirit needed – sometimes you just have to do what needs doing for
        the team, regardless of your title or planned role.</strong></p>

    <p>But not all unexpected events are manageable with flexibility alone. We faced a major blow when the Federation
        President, our mentor and friend who had supported us so enthusiastically, passed away suddenly. He was in good
        health, full of life – it was a complete shock. Beyond the deep personal loss, it created instability. As often
        happens in politics, his successor wanted to review things, perhaps start from scratch, which created friction
        and new obstacles for our operations just as we were gaining momentum. It was a harsh lesson in resilience, in how quickly things can change due to factors completely outside your
        control, and the need to find a way to carry on even when grieving and facing renewed uncertainty. These sudden losses – my early coach, the Federation President – were harsh lessons in more than just resilience. They hammered home the brutal unpredictability of life, the stark reality that any day could indeed be the last, and that eventually, one day will be. It forces a perspective shift: if everything we build, everything we hope for, can vanish so quickly, perhaps leaving no trace within a few generations, then maybe we shouldn't take ourselves, or our worldly stresses, quite so seriously. It's not about apathy or giving up; it's about embracing the ride, living more genuinely, more mindfully in the present, focusing on the connections made and the effort itself, rather than getting consumed by anxieties about outcomes that are ultimately beyond our control. Be ready for the unthinkable, because it happens.</p>

    <h3>The Finish Line: Mission Accomplished & Moving On</h3>
    <p>Despite the challenges, the setbacks, the endless grind, we achieved what we set out to do. The big brands came
        to Italy. Races were established. And there's a quiet satisfaction in knowing that one of the major races
        happening in Italy today uses a course we originally pioneered. The mission, in that sense, was accomplished.
    </p>

    <p>So, we had done it. Against considerable odds, the races were established, the big brands had a foothold in
        Italy, and a seed we planted was growing. The initial mission felt accomplished.</p>
        
    <p>And it was around this time
        that I started to reflect deeply on my own path. While the journey had been incredibly rewarding in terms of
        challenge and learning, I also had to be honest with myself. The day-to-day reality of running the company,
        especially the constant, full-time engagement with public administration and politics, wasn't where my long-term
        passion truly lay. The world of technology, my original field, kept pulling me back with its different kinds of
        problems to solve. Having achieved the goal I'd set out years earlier – to bring these brands to my home country
        – I felt I could step away with a sense of completion, ready for the next adventure. It wasn't about ending
        something, but about closing a significant chapter and starting a new one, <strong>carrying the lessons learned with me.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Lesson: Teams Forged in the Grinder</h3>
    <p>One of the deepest convictions that solidified during that intense period was about how truly strong teams are
        built.</p>

    <p>My experience leading those incredible volunteers, and working alongside the core team through immense pressure, confirmed something I think I always felt: great teams aren't forged in comfortable settings like happy hours or playing games. They are forged in 'the grinder' – by tackling difficult challenges together, facing setbacks, working tirelessly towards a common goal, and sharing the vulnerability and triumph of that process.</p>

    <p>There's an
        inner beauty and a deep bond that comes from going through hardship together. It's probably why I sometimes find
        superficial situations difficult; the connection feels more real when it's built on shared effort and purpose.
        It's the same satisfaction I find in things like volunteering for community projects – doing real work,
        side-by-side, that makes a difference.</p>

    <h3>Lesson: True Impact Lifts Others</h3>
    <p>And perhaps the most heartwarming lessons came from the human connections made along the way. I remember vividly
        a young woman we worked with in Sardinia. She was incredibly passionate about sports and dreamed of working for
        a major sports organisation. When we told her we were bringing a large international race to her island, she
        couldn't believe it. She worked around the clock for us, with infectious enthusiasm, even though we couldn't
        guarantee her a full salary at the beginning; we gave her what we could. Her dedication was inspiring. After our
        project phase, we were so grateful for her contribution that we helped introduce her to RCS Sport – the
        organisation behind huge events like the Giro d'Italia. She got her break, achieved her dream of working in
        professional sports organisation.</p>

    <p>Years later, completely out of the blue, she reached out to me. Knowing my passion for cycling, she had obtained
        an original cycling jersey from one of my heroes, Marco Pantani, during her work travels. She sent it to me as a
        gift. She remembered me, remembered the chance we gave her, however small or messy it might have seemed at the
        time, that helped her step towards her dream. It was a powerful reminder that sometimes, amidst all the stress
        and logistics of achieving a big goal, the most lasting impact is on the individual lives you touch and the
        opportunities you can help create.</p>

    <p>Following your own dreams feels even better when you can help someone else take a step towards theirs.</p>

    <h3>Lesson: Growth Through Embracing the Impossible</h3>
    <p>So, what's the final takeaway from pouring years of energy into such a demanding venture? For me, it's the
        undeniable value of taking on challenges that seem too big, too complex. You might not stay in that specific
        field forever, you might move on to other things, but <strong>the person who comes out the other side is fundamentally
        changed.</strong> You learn about the world, about people, and most importantly, about yourself – your limits, your
        resilience, your values. And those lessons stay with you, long after the race is over</p>
